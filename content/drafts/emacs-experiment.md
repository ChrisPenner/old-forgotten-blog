Impressions:
    * Feels awkward at first, mapping caps-lock to control helps a lot!
    * Might also map Command to meta, should make it less awkward to press.
    * I'm glad I learned Buffer flow from vim, looks like it's the way it's done
        in emacs.
    * I'm currently writing this in VIM, guess I'm not comfortable enough yet.
    * Though at first seemingly random, most of the mappings seem to follow a
        stable pattern. I'm enjoying the way the kill ring seems to work, it was
        always a good idea. I set that up with YankRing in Vim
    * Read a very interesting take on how modal editing is the interesting
        thing, and how vim just happens to be the best at it right now. I could
        see myself switching to evil-mode emacs just like the author did, but
        I'll start with vanilla emacs first and learn my way around.
