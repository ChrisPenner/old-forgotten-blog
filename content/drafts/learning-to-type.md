title: Learning to Type Again

About 6 months ago I realized that as someone going into Computer Science I would likely be typing for the rest of my life. Somewhere on the internet I read that learning how to properly use a text editor could not only help me type faster, but also use fewer overall key strokes and keep me focused on the task at hand. These posts all came with the disclaimer that it would take time, effort, and that learning something new would slow me down at the start. I realized that if I can spend a few hours here and there to save myself countless hours throughout my career, it doesn't take complex mental math to see that it'd be worthwhile.

So I started researching the best editor to learn, there're hundreds out there, and most shortcuts and advanced techniques tend to be non-transferable. After a short period of watching some videos and reading a thing or two I quickly uncovered the presence of the everlasting holy war between Emacs and Vi users. I've never been interested in being a fanboy, I don't particularly care what anyone else uses so long as I'm content with what I have. Fortunately, though it's nearly impossible to get any sort of idea of which one is "best" it's actually quite easy to get an objective assessment of what makes them different.
