I was playing the wonderful game [Crypt of the Necrodancer](http://necrodancer.com/) today, when I realized something that's so incredibly obvious that I often forget it. **When it comes to presenting information, pictures work better than words or numbers.**

I'll make this quick, in a frenzied game where you're moving to the beat of the music, you have only milliseconds to make decisions regarding the information presented to you on-screen. One of the most important things is how much health you, and your enemies have. Take a look at these pictures below and see which one is easier to read.

See how much of a difference that makes? The icons make for a clear and quick way to tell what you need to know, no need to think of how much 3/5 is, and whether it's enough to take another hit from that Minotaur.
