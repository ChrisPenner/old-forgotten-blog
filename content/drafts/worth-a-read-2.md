This marks the beginning of a new feature, *Worth a Read* will contain a quick
and easy list of blog posts and articles that I've found interesting recently.
They may have to do with programming, design, lifestyle, cool products, or
anything else I've been reading. Might be themed, might not! Hope you enjoy it!
