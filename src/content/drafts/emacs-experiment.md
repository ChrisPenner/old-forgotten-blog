## Day One
    * Feels awkward at first, mapping caps-lock to control helps a lot!
    * Might also map Command to meta, should make it less awkward to press.
    * I'm glad I learned Buffer flow from vim, looks like it's the way it's done
        in emacs.
    * I'm currently writing this in VIM, guess I'm not comfortable enough yet.
    * Though at first seemingly random, most of the mappings seem to follow a
        stable pattern. I'm enjoying the way the kill ring seems to work, it was
        always a good idea. I set that up with YankRing in Vim
    * Read a very interesting take on how modal editing is the interesting
        thing, and how vim just happens to be the best at it right now. I could
        see myself switching to evil-mode emacs just like the author did, but
        I'll start with vanilla emacs first and learn my way around.

## Day Two
    * Mapped right-hand command key to Meta, Much better
    * Struggling with packages, it has a built in package manager, but I'd like
    to keep everything in configuration files for easy reinstallation,
    * I've tried a few different package managers, I can't understand how to get
        them working well.
    * I'd love to try LaTeX integration, but who has time for that.
    * Regular expression search seems pretty cool, didn't realize you could use
        groupings, but now I realized you can also do that in vim.
    * Ability to run functions in search and replace is pretty sweet.
    * Already getting the hang of movement keys, found myself C-n and C-p'ing
        when I jumped back to vim for a second.
    * Getting seriously annoyed with just the feeling of general
        uncomfortable-ness associated with the unknown.
    * Going to try to keep from switching to evil-mode for at least a month,
        though I'm not sure I'll last that long.
